\section{Random Networks}
\subsection{Erdös-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz Networks}
An Erdös-Rényi is a network generated by starting from a set of vertices $V$ and for for each possible edge $(v1, v2)$ decide with a probability $p$ whether it is present or not. This means that the runtime of a naive implementation of this generator is of order $O(|V|^2)$. An alternative is to start from the known degree distribution of any vertex 
\begin{align}
p(k) = \left( \stackrel{n-1}{k} \right) p^k (1-p)^{n-1-k} \label{eq:degree_hist}
\end{align}, from which we get the distribution of total edge number by summing over all $n$ vertices (counting twice). The sum of binomials with the same probability is again a binomial distribution [cite?, wiki], with
\begin{align}
P(k) = \left( \stackrel{n(n-1) }{k} \right) p^k (1-p)^{n(n-1)-k}.
\end{align}
Since we know that all edges are equally probable, we now can first determine the total number of edges present according to $P$, and then just select the appropriate amount of edges randomly from all possibilities. The runtime scales with the number of edges and thus is $O(n^2 p)$, i.e. it is still quadratic in $n$ but gets faster as the probability for edges decreases.

The results of this algorithm can be seen in fig. \ref{}, where we have used a preselected number of edges instead of an edge probability to generate the graphs.

The degree distribution eq. \eqref{eq:degree_hist} is vizualized in figure \ref{}.

Many real world networks exhibit so called small world behaviour, i.e. most connections are local (high clustering coefficient) but there are sufficently many global shortcuts (small average path length). This cannot be achieved with Erdös-Rényi networks, however, the description above already gives us a starting point for a new graph generator algorithm: Start with a graph that only has local connections, and then rewire each edge with probability $p$ to a long range connection. This is what the Watts Strogatz Algorithm does. Starting from a regular ring, where each node is connected to $k$ neighbours, we rewire each edge with probability $k$. This can be seen in figure \ref{}.

\subsection{Small world effect}
To find out under which conditions a Watts-Strogatz graph fulfills the small world condition, we look at average path length and clustering coefficient in dependece of $p$. For $k=2$, there is almost no clustering because the initial regular ring does not contain nay triangles. Therefore, we look at $k=4$, which is depicted in fig. \ref{}.
