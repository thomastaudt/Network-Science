\section{Random Networks}
\subsection{Erdös-Rényi and Small World Networks}
An Erdös-Rényi is a network generated by starting from a set of vertices $V$ and for for each possible edge $(v1, v2)$ decide with a probability $p$ whether it is present or not. This means that the runtime of a naive implementation of this generator is of order $O(|V|^2)$. An alternative is to start from the known degree distribution of any vertex 
\begin{align}
p(k) = \left( \stackrel{n-1}{k} \right) p^k (1-p)^{n-1-k}
\end{align}, from which we get the distribution of total edge number by summing over all $n$ vertices (counting twice). The sum of binomials with the same probability is again a binomial distribution [cite?, wiki], with
\begin{align}
P(k) = \left( \stackrel{n(n-1) }{k} \right) p^k (1-p)^{n(n-1)-k}.
\end{align}
Since we know that all edges are equally probable, we now can first determine the total number of edges present according to $P$, and then just select the appropriate amount of edges randomly from all possibilities. The runtime scales with the number of edges and thus is $O(\stackrel{n}{2} p)$, i.e. it is still quadratic in $n$ but gets faster as the probability for edges decreases.

The results of this algorithm can be seen in fig. \ref{}, where we have used a preselected number of edges instead of an edge probability to generate the graphs.

    = m_0 = 3$. From left to right and from top to bottom single nodes are
    first added before edges are chosen according to the preferential
    attachment probabilities printed in blue. The last picture shows the network
    after 47 nodes have been added.}

    nodes have been added (left: without drawing the edges, and right: with
    drawing the edges). The color and the size of the nodes printed in the left
    and right picture describe the degree of the respective node. The
    picture in the middle shows the degree distribution (with the same color
