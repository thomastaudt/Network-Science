\section{Epidemics on Networks}
We consider an epidemic model in which each node is always in exactly one of the states \emph{susceptible}, \emph{infected} or \emph{recovered}. 
In every timestep, each infected node infects susceptible neighbours with probability $\beta$ and each infected node recovers with probability $\gamma$. 
The first five timesteps of evolving these dynamics on a BA network of $N=50$ nodes and $k=3$ are shown in figure \ref{}.

If all nodes connected to a susceptible node recover before they infect it, that node will never become infected (upper left node in figure \ref{}). How likely this is to happen depends on the infection and recovery probabilities $\beta$ and $\gamma$. 
It therefore seems sensible to define $q$ as the percentage of nodes that ever were infected. 
It can be calculated by simulating the network dynamics until there are no more infected nodes and is then given by the percentage of recovered nodes.

\section{Inferring Network Structure}
The phrase \enquote{if you want to understand function, study structure}
uttered by Francis Crick is a common credo in biochemistry, applied
successfully to analyze and understand the function of large molecules. For
networks too, their structure, meaning the topology and the weigth
distributions, determine what the network can and can't do. This section's
task is to reverse this idea in a certain way: What can be deduced about
the structure of a network when having access to (some of) the output it
produces?

\subsection{Reconstructing Small Networks with Kuramoto Dynamics}
The approach used in order to reconstruct networks with oscillatory
Kuramoto dynamics can be found in the uploaded instruction and the
formulation of the task. The notation used in the following also coincides
with the notation of the instruction, if not introduced elsewise. The
pseudo inverse matrix was calculated with the function
\texttt{numpy.linalg.pinv()} provided by the \texttt{numpy} library.
The most important remarks regarding the simulation and the obtained
results are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The integration time step for the Euler integration of the
        Kuramoto dynamic was $\dif t = 0.01$.
    \item Linearly spaced values $(T\ix{i})\ix{i=0}\Ix{M+2} \subset [0,
        T\ix{max}]$ were used as sample times. $M+2$ sample times had to be
        used in order to calculate the approximate derivatives for the border values. 
    \item The quality of the reconstructed adjacency matrix $\bar{K}$
        compared to the original matrix $K$ was measured by the quantity $Q_{95}$
        that was also used in a figure of the handout. It is defined
        in the publication of M. Timme and J. Casadiego, J. Phys. A: Math.
        Theor. 47 343001 (2014).
    \item The quality measures $\bar{Q}_{95}$ given below for one set $(N,
        M, T\ix{max})$ of parameters are the averaged $Q_{95}$ values for
        10000 trials.
\end{itemize}

The obtained results for different combinations of $(N, M, T\ix{max})$ are
presented and visualized in figure \ref{fig:D211}. The reconstructions
obtained for $N = 5$ have a good quality that is confirmed by both the high
$Q_{95}$ values and the given visualizations, where the difference networks
have few and thin edges. As expected, higher values of $M$ potentially
increase the quality while lower values decrease it.

The reconstruction quality is visibly worse for $N = 10$ while the values
of $Q_{95} \approx 0.40$ for $M = 100$ and $T = 2$ as well as
$Q_{95}\approx 0.8$ for $M = 200$ and $T = 4$ again indicate that more
measurements improve the result visibly.


\subsection{Reconstructing Larger Networks}
When trying to reconstruct larger networks, the applied method in the
considered parameter space seems to get increasingly unsuitable. While for
$N=12$ and  $M = 100, T\ix{max} = 2$ the average quality was around
$\bar{Q}_{95}\approx 0.35$ it dropped to values lower then $0.3$ for even
higher $N$. One can, however, apparently increase the reconstruction
quality by taking more measurements (possibly over a longer period of
time): For example, $N=12, M=200$, and $T\ix{max}=4$ yields
$\bar{Q}_{95}\approx 0.59$. Nevertheless, the quality could not be
arbitrarily improved with higher values for $M$ and/or $T\ix{max}$ in our
attempts and in fact never really got much higher than $0.6$.  
% N = 5, T = 2, M = 100 -> Q_ = 0.94
% N = 5, T = 4, M = 150 -> Q_ = 0.96
% N = 5, T = 3, M = 50  -> Q_ = 0.92

% N = 10,

        difference graph (last column) was obtained by taking the

\section{Continuative Topics}
\subsection{Balance in Social Networks}
In the following the \emph{social balance model} with \emph{local triad
dynamics} (described on the handout for D4.1) with $p = 1/3$ is applied on
a network that supposedly represents the family structure of Romeo's and
Juliet's families, presented in figure \ref{fig:D41} (a).  (According to
our research, Juliet has no living siblings at the time the drama takes
place, and Romeo never had siblings at all.)

Some exemplary simulation results are given in figure \ref{fig:D41} (b),
(c), and (d).
An obvious and quite frequent result was the one depicted in figure \ref{fig:D41}
(b), meaning that Romeo and Juliet turned into foes while the family
internals remained untouched.  One could also observe that the family
structures got broken up and mixed sometimes, building two new fractions
(figure \ref{fig:D41} (c)). An event that was very rare (see the results for
$P\ix{paradies}$ below) was the complete conciliation of all persons,
figure \ref{fig:D41} (d).

Having applied the local triad algorithm with $p = 1/3$ for $10000$ trials
yielded that the probability $P\ix{love}$ of Romeo and Juliet still being together after
the social balance has been established is approximately $P\ix{love}25\%$.
The probability of paradise, $P\ix{paradies}$, was .

The dependency of $P\ix{love}$ and $P\ix{paradies}$ on the pattern
selection probability $p$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:D412}. One can
see that the both probabilities increase with increasing $p$, which is
of course expected.
